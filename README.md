UMA-Playground
==============

Playground project for Unity Multipurpose Avatar. The idea is to create an open, functional in-game editor for UMA that can be used for basic character generator.

## Planned Features

1. Create character and modify UMA attributes using GUI:
    * DNA
    * Color (skin tone, hair, clothing)
    * Slot's elements
2. Save and Load character to UMA recipe.
3. Modern shader (hair, eyes, skin, cloth) for the UMA character.
4. Scenes for testing performance (ex: party simulation).
